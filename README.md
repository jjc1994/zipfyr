# zipfyr
A high-low guessing game based on the English language

## Title: 
Ziphyr

## Description: 
Do you think you can handle high-low with random playing cards?
No? Then, try guessing which English words have a higher or lower word frequency than the other.
Two random English words will be generated by a random English word API.
Then, the Datamuse API will be called to retrieve the word frequency after a player selection has been made to verify the answer.
Note that if in the rare instance that both words happen to have the same word frequency, the player wins regardless.
In addition, if an HTTPS error message pops up, a "Try Again" button will appear.

## Wireframes: 
Note that for tablet and mobile, landscape is the preferred orientation.

## API: 
Random Word API
Datamuse API
```
const api1 = () => axios({
        method: 'get',
        url: "https://random-word.ryanrk.com/api/en/word/random"
    })
    .then(function(response) {
        console.log("Y");
        console.log(response);
        api2(response.data[0]);
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
        console.log("N");
        console.log(error);
    });
const api2 = (word) => axios.get("https://api.datamuse.com/words/?sp=" + word + "&max=1&md=fr")
    .then(function(response) {
        console.log("Y");
        console.log(response.data);
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
        console.log("N");
        console.log(error);
    });
api1();
```

## MVP: 
1. Be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - The HTML5 and CSS will be barebones compared to the JavaScript bulk. 
  - The CSS background will change color depending on whether the answer picked is correct or incorrect.
2. Use Axios to consume data from an external source, and render that data into the DOM.
  - Axios will be used to call 2 separate APIs.
3. Use flexbox (display: flex) and/or CSS grid (display: grid).
  - CSS grid will be used to split the screen into two parts for the main section with the words.
4. Implement responsive design on 3 screen sizes (including desktop) using 2 media queries (tablet and mobile).
  - Note that for tablet and mobile, landscape is the preferred orientation.
5. Host on Surge. 
  - I hope so.
  
## Post-MVP: 
Use two APIs instead of one.
